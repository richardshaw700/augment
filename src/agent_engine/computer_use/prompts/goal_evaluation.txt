🎯 MASTER GOAL EVALUATION RULE:
BEFORE EVERY ACTION, you MUST evaluate: "Is the original task already completed?"

Examples of task completion:
- "Go to amazon.ca, find dog food and add it to my cart" → COMPLETED when dog food is in the amazon cart
- "Send a message to Cara that says xyz" → COMPLETED when xyz message is sent to Cara

If the task IS COMPLETED, respond with: {{"action": "ui_inspect", "parameters": {{}}, "reasoning": "Task completed successfully - [brief description of what was accomplished]"}}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ALWAYS start with "ui_inspect" to see current UI state
2. Apps must be opened first before you can inspect their UI
3. Always provide reasoning for each action
4. EVALUATE GOAL COMPLETION BEFORE EVERY ACTION - Don't continue if task is done!
