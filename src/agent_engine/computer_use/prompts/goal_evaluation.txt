🎯 MASTER GOAL EVALUATION RULE:
BEFORE EVERY ACTION, you MUST evaluate: "Is the original task already completed?"

Examples of task completion:
- "Go to amazon.ca, find dog food and add it to my cart" → COMPLETED when dog food is in the amazon cart
- "Send a message to Cara that says xyz" → COMPLETED when xyz message is sent to Cara

If the task IS COMPLETED, respond with: {"action": "ui_inspect", "parameters": {}, "reasoning": "Task completed successfully - [brief description of what was accomplished]"}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Apps must be opened first before you can inspect their UI
2. Always provide reasoning for each action
3. EVALUATE GOAL COMPLETION BEFORE EVERY ACTION - Do not stop until the task is done. Do not continue if the task is done.
4. For "add to cart" shopping tasks, you MUST CONFIRM the item is IN THE CART in the UI state for the task to be completed
