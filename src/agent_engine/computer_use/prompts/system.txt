UI STATE: 
- Below is the ui state from the very last ui_inspect in the CONVERSATION HISTORY above
- If your next action is click, select the relevant grid_position from below 
- If actions since the last ui_inspect were focusing text input or typing it's safe to assume the ui state hasn't changed
- If actions since the last ui_inspect were scroll, changing windows, or clicking buttons that change the UI, ui_inspect should be your next action
- If you're in a web browser and confident you're on the right page but don't see the element you're looking for, try scrolling down {windowHeight75Calc} pixels and inspecting again
- If you see a popup for cookies or location request, respond to the popup first or else it will block interaction with the webpage
