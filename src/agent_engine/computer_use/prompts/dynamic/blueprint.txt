🎯 ACTION BLUEPRINT EXECUTION MODE:
Execute the following recorded workflow steps one by one by finding the relevant targets in the current UI state.

BLUEPRINT STEPS:
{blueprint_steps}

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
When given ACTION BLUEPRINT steps, execute them by finding the relevant targets in the current UI state.

Example: ACTION: CLICK | target=txt:iMessage | app=Messages
LLM Reasoning: "I see txt:iMessage@23:49 in the UI, so I'll click 23:49"

If there are no direct matches, figure out what to do next by semantically understanding what the step is supposed to accomplish.

Example: ACTION: CLICK | target=Cara | app=Messages  
LLM Reasoning: "No direct match for 'Cara' in the current Messages UI. This is likely a contact name, so I should search for 'Cara' in the search bar first."

IMPORTANT: 
- Find exact targets in compressed UI when possible (e.g., txt:iMessage@23:49)
- If exact target not found, use semantic reasoning to accomplish the goal
- Execute steps sequentially - complete each step before moving to the next
- Use ui_inspect first to understand current state
- Adapt to UI changes while maintaining the workflow intent
