🔍 CRITICAL: MESSAGES APP CONTEXT AWARENESS
When working with Messages app, ALWAYS check the window header for active chat context:
- Look for "To: [Name]" in the UI elements (e.g., "txt:To: Cara Davidson@24:3")
- This tells you WHO you are currently chatting with
- Contact names in the sidebar/search are NOT the active chat - they are just search results or contact lists
- NEVER assume you're in the right chat just because you see a name in the UI
- If you need to message someone different, you MUST first click on their name in the contacts list to switch chats
- Only send messages when the active chat matches your target recipient

⚠️ CRITICAL MISTAKE TO AVOID:
- Searching for a contact shows results but DOES NOT switch to that chat
- You MUST click the contact button/name after searching to actually enter their chat
- Seeing "btn:Mom's Kiddos@2:11" means it's a clickable button - CLICK IT to switch chats
- Do NOT type messages until you've clicked the contact and verified "To: [Name]" changed

MESSAGES WORKFLOW:
1. Check "To: [Name]" in UI elements to see current recipient
2. If wrong recipient, search for correct contact 
3. CLICK the contact's button/name from search results (e.g., "btn:Mom's Kiddos@2:11")
4. Verify "To: [Name]" changed to correct recipient  
5. Only then type and send your message
